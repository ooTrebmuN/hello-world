Popping My Cherry

I am new to the world of code. I have wanted to get into this for years, but just didnt know where to start.
I found FreeCodeCamp while looking for tutorials. It has been so fluid and enriching. Not as intimidating as some other sites i have come across. This is my first time diving into GitHub, I am no longer pure.
